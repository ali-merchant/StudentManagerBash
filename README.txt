Welcome to the Student Management System

To run the Program first set up a teachers credentials in the teacher_credential.txt
If needed also set Students Credentials for student login


To proceed with the system 
run the following command first :
	chmod +x *.sh
in the respective directory

then launch the ./main.sh

this will take you to the front page of the system now you can login as teacher ( add delete students, update marks etc) You can also login as student to see grades of that student for every teachers course he or she is enrolled in 

Thank you for being here
Cheers
